# Java-Problems
This consists of all probems found on Part 1 of the Object Oriented programming from University of Helsinki's MOOC available here: 
http://mooc.fi/courses/2013/programming-part-1/


## What this course consisted of:
Through this course, I have learnt the basics of computer programming, along with algorithms and object-oriented programming through the Java programming language. 

### Part 1: the basics:

e first part of the course focuses on taking the plunge with programming and getting familiar with all the required tools. During the part 1, I learnt the basic syntax of Java. I became familiar with the 'NetBeans with TMC' development environment used in this course, The goal in this sdection was to:

Know what a "string" refers to in programming.
Know how to join (i.e., "concatenate") strings together.
Understand the concept of a variable. You know what variable types, names, and values are.
Know how to create and use string, integer, floating-point, and boolean variables.


- Become familiar with the idea of a conditional statement and know how to create a program containing optional operations through the use of conditional statements.
- Become familiar with comparison and logical operators commonly used in conditional statements.
- Know how to compare both numbers and strings, remembering the equals-command for strings.
- Become familiar with the order of execution for a conditional statement, and know that the parsing of a conditional statement stops at the first condition whose statement evaluates to true.

### Part 2: Recurring problems and patterns to solve them

The second part focused heavily on making use of what was learnt in part 1, how to tackle problem solving, repetition in programs and on how to divide functionality into distinct units.

##### Problem solving:
- Recognized that certain sub-problems, such as reading input or calculations, recur in programs.
- Became aware of solution models to certain sub-problems.
- Practiced combining solution patterns used on sub-problems to solve broader ones.

##### Repeating functionality

Learning outcomes:
- Learnt how to use the break command to end a loop's execution.
- Learnt how to use continue command to return to the beginning of a loop.
- Recognized situations where a while loop should be used and those where a for loop is more appropriate.
- Learnt how to create methods and how to call them from both the main program (the main method) as well as from inside other methods.
##### Repeating functionality


### Part 3: Recurring problems and patterns to solve them

The main themes in the third part of the course are adding information to list and array data structures, and handling information in string form.
- Know the term perceptual blindness, and can learn to recognize essential (and non-essential) information with practice.
- Know ways to comment code, and understand the importance of variable names on readability of your code.
- Know the concept print-debugging, and know how to search for errors in the source code by printing.
